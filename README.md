An interactive educational quiz game to help learners master Italian family vocabulary through context-based questions.

## 🎯 Game Purpose

This game is designed to help users learn Italian family member terms not through direct translation, but by understanding familial relationships in Italian context. Each question presents a relationship description in Italian (e.g., "È la madre di mio padre"), and players must choose the correct family member term from four options.

- **Mobile-first responsive design** that works on all devices

- **Educational UI** with hints and explanations
- **Progress tracking** and score system
